# Local CLI Architecture

The CLI contains no application UI, persistence writer or cloud authentication.
It reads the running desktop's owner-only connection descriptor and uses the
versioned API exclusively on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. Redirects are rejected.
No environment token or saved cloud API URL can override this boundary.

One desktop data directory owns one `local` Workspace and its Projects. Inbox
is reserved. Project writes are currently performed in the desktop UI.

```text
CLI -> loopback HTTP + per-launch token -> Tauri -> desktop domain/store
                                                   -> atomic local file
```

The loopback API preserves the existing task and Milestone endpoint shapes:

```text
GET /api/v1/workspaces
GET /api/v1/workspaces/local/projects
GET|POST /api/v1/workspaces/local/milestones
GET|POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/tasks
GET /api/v1/tasks/:taskId
POST /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/mutations
POST /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments
GET /api/v1/milestones/:milestoneId
POST /api/v1/milestones/:milestoneId/mutations
GET /api/v1/workspaces/local/audit
POST /api/v1/mutations/:mutationId/undo
```

Existing entity writes require `expectedVersion`. Create/update/comment requests
require `Idempotency-Key`. Audit, replay results and the latest undo snapshot live
in a versioned optional extension to V12, persisted atomically with task state.
Undo fails when subsequent desktop edits changed the snapshot.

The desktop rejects Origin-bearing browser requests and unexpected Host values.
The security boundary is the operating-system user, not per-Agent permissions.
Same-user processes can use the CLI. No listener is exposed to LAN interfaces.

Agents discover IDs, preview intended changes and obtain human confirmation
before mutation. The root `skills/lightflux/` documents this workflow and is
installed by the open Skills CLI.
